# Machine Learning Algorithmic Trading Project 2

![Machine_Learning_Algorithmic Trading Project 2](./Images/algoimage1.jpeg)

Algorithmic trading relies on computer programs that execute algorithms to automate some or all elements of a trading strategy. Algorithms are a sequence of steps or rules designed to achieve a goal. They can take many forms and facilitate optimization throughout the investment process, from idea generation to asset allocation, trade execution, and risk management.

Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms that learn rules or patterns from data to achieve a goal such as minimizing a prediction error. The examples in this book will illustrate how ML algorithms can extract information from data to support or automate key investment activities. These activities include observing the market and analyzing data to form expectations about the future and decide on placing buy or sell orders, as well as managing the resulting portfolio to produce attractive returns relative to the risk.

Ultimately, the goal of active investment management is to generate alpha, defined as portfolio returns in excess of the benchmark used for evaluation. The fundamental law of active management postulates that the key to generating alpha is having accurate return forecasts combined with the ability to act on these forecasts (Grinold 1989; Grinold and Kahn 2000).

## Python Libraries

Before attempting to execute any Python code in machine_learning_algorithmic_trading_project_2.ipynb, it is helpful if your development environment holds the following modules:

- matplotlib [docs](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- numpy [docs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- pandas [docs](https://github.com/pydata/pandas)
- scipy [docs](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
- scikit-learn [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
- TensorFlow [docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)
- PyTorch [docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
- seaborn [docs](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)
- statsmodels [docs](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels)
- Machine Learning Financial Laboratory (mlfinlab) [docs](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation Guide

With your _Python 3.7+_ environment, run the following commands via CLI:

```
from datetime import datetime
import requests
import config
import pandas as pd
import time

```

## Usage

1. Clone repository onto your personal machine.

2. Open Google Colab link or a Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Navigator and navigate to the directory in which the file machine_learning_algorithmic_trading_project_2.ipynb is present. All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and Python modules are installed (see Technologies and Installation Guide for more details) before attempting to execute code within Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors!

3. With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "Machine Learning Algorithmic Trading" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors!
